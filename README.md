## Approach: Summary & Benefits

### 1. **Admins Upload Official PDFs**
- Ensures quality, consistency, and unity for the cohort.
- Reduces risk of spam, duplicates, and excessive API usage.

### 2. **Users Can Create Personal Mixtures**
- Empowers users to combine existing PDFs into custom “sets” for their own study needs.
- No new content is uploaded to the system, so resource usage is controlled.
- Users get personalization without fragmenting the official content.

### 3. **PDF Request Queue for Users**
- Users can request new PDFs (e.g., upload or suggest a file).
- Admins review and approve requests, deciding what becomes part of the official library.
- Keeps the content library relevant and user-driven, but with quality control.

## How to Implement This (Feature/UX Suggestions)

### A. **Roles & Permissions**
- **Admin:** Can upload PDFs, approve/reject user requests, manage official content.
- **User:** Can view/solve official PDFs, create personal mixtures, and request new PDFs.

### B. **Personal Mixtures**
- UI for users to select from existing PDFs and “mix” them into a custom set.
- These mixtures are private to the user (unless you want to allow sharing).

### C. **PDF Request Queue**
- Users can submit a PDF (or a link/description).
- Requests appear in an admin dashboard/queue.
- Admins can approve (add to official library) or reject (optionally with feedback).
- Optionally, notify users when their request is approved/rejected.

### D. **Resource Management**
- No direct user uploads to the official library, so Groq/API usage is predictable.
- Optionally, limit the number of personal mixtures or requests per user.

## UX Example

- **Official PDFs:**
  > “These are the PDFs your class is working on, uploaded by your instructor.”
- **Personal Mixtures:**
  > “Create your own study set by mixing any PDFs you have access to.”
- **Request a PDF:**
  > “Need a PDF that’s not here? Request it and your instructor will review it.”

## Why This Is a Best Practice

- **Balances control and freedom:**
  - Admins keep the library organized, but users aren’t blocked from customizing their experience.
- **Scalable:**
  - As your user base grows, you won’t run into runaway costs or content chaos.
- **Engaging:**
  - Users feel heard (via requests) and empowered (via mixtures).

## Next Steps (If You Want to Build This)

1. Define user roles in your backend (admin, user).
2. Build the PDF request queue (backend + admin UI).
3. Implement personal mixtures (frontend UI + backend logic).
4. Restrict PDF upload endpoints to admins only.
5. (Optional) Add notifications for request status.
